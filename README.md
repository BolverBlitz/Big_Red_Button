A Twitch tool to ***ban*** users from your chat, with automatic ***dedection of bad word***s, with a nice ***big red butto***n and if you want, a fancy countdown.

## Keys
***S***: Will show the settings page  
***H***: Will toggle the visability of everything*  
  
*This will terminate the backround dots, so they ***won´t*** cost you any CPU performance!  

## Usage
***BRB Twich Settings:***  
***Brodcast to Chat:*** Write that the user was baned and the reason.  
***Coutdown:*** Enable a fancy countdown after that the user will be baned.  
***Stream hidden mode***: Toggle visability off after a bad happend.

## Setup for Streaming
For ***OBS*** you can import the browser however you like (Window Source).  
You can apply a ***chroma key*** effect on color ***'#24282f'*** to use this as an ***"overlay"***.  
If you use this as overlay, you should enable ***"Auto toggle hidden mode"*** and ***"Stream hidden mode"*** on!  
If you dislike the automated toggle, you can ALWAYS use the H key to toggle it :D  

## Security
This application dosn´t store ***AND*** of your data on the server its served by, everything runs directly in your browser :D

## Setup for Hosting

You can run this tool on ***any webserver*** without any setup.
